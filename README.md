## Overview 
This is a Flask web app which predicts a heart failure based on clinical data.
You can find more details on the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data.
For this version we choose the K Nearest Neighbour to do our prediction after do our pre-processing treatments and comparing many models.
You can see how we work by opening the .ipynb file .
